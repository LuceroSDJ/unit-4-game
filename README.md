##This game is a little challenging, but it is so much fun!
##Let's execise our math and memory skills!
###Please follow the instructions below:
*I will randomly choose a number and display it for you on the page.
*Then, your job is to match my number by clicking on the crystals as many times as needed.
*Note that I will keep the value of each crystal hidden until you click on them. This is where your memory skills will shine.
*Do the math as you click on the crystals.
*If your total score is the same as my number, you win!
