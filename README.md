## This game is a little challenging, but it is so much fun!
## Let's execise our math and memory skills!
### Please follow the instructions below:
* I will randomly choose a number between 19 and 120, and I will display it for you on the page.
* Then, your job is to match my number by clicking on the crystals as many times as needed.
* Note that I will keep the value of each crystal hidden until you click on them. 
* Each crystal will have a hidden value between 1 and 12.
* Do the math as you click on the crystals.
* If your total score is the same as my number, you win!
* This is where your memory skills will shine.
